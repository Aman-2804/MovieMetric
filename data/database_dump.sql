20227	Michael Jackson: Live in Bucharest - The Dangerous Tour	Michael Jackson's "Dangerous Tour" still sets the bar high for every touring artist today. Outdoing himself with the "Bad Tour", which was already considered the ultimate, the gigantic stage setting consisting of 20 trucks and a lavish arsenal of personnel took almost three days to set up - that alone is a logistical superlative for a worldwide tour with 69 concert stops and 3.5 million fans. The highlights of the show included pyrotechnic effects, several stage illusions and a stuntman. True to his aim of spreading love around the world, Jackson donated the proceeds from the tour (over $100 million) to charity. On October 1, 1992, the image and sound recordings that are hotly sought after by Jackson fans around the world were also made. The concert recording, which was broadcast on the HBO channel, picked up in 60 countries and also transmitted by countless radio stations, still inspires people around the globe.	1992-10-02	Music	[{"id": 10402, "name": "Music"}]	8.6	126	2.7988	/4BieRMMCQP9v2kR0JI1grmhVmr5.jpg	/rPWfZW0494nkLkXEhd5WjvWcsj3.jpg	122	0	0		Released	f	t	2025-12-19 04:06:19.456853+00	2025-12-19 04:06:19.456853+00

He interviews blue-collar workers, intellectuals, college students, rural farmers, the bourgeoisie, and every other kind of people, painting a vivid portrait of a rapidly-industrializing Italy, hanging between modernity and tradition — toward both of which Pasolini shows equal distrust.	1965-07-05	Documentary	[{"id": 99, "name": "Documentary"}]	8.253	286	4.1031	/olOuK4gkrYzgo7xJWR1EugZ2vdS.jpg	/sn5dvn1g977bejLHGyMUlXeEXn7.jpg	88	0	2248		Released	f	t	2025-12-19 04:18:34.013337+00	2025-12-19 04:18:34.013337+00
